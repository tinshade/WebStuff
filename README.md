# RANDOM IMAGE RANDOM PLACE
A simple JS, HTML project that allows spawning of random images from a set of given images, at a random place, from a set of given spawn areas.

I made this to be used as a background to a Jumbotron to attact and stall the user's attention whilst they read the text on the foreground of the Jumbotron.

The feature is live at : http://palforests.com/Afforestation if you want to check it out for yourself.

PS. The Open Source version does not include the CSS and BootStrap used in the actual implementation.

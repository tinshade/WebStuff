Clicking on a bird's image will play the sound that particular bird makes. This is a achieved by simple JS and HTML with a bit of CSS and BootStrap to make things look pretty.

The feature is live and can be checked out here : http://palforests.com/gallery . Navigate to 'Chirpers' Section and tap on any bird to learn more about it, whilst enjoying the sound it makes.



PS. I can not add the CSS or the website's actual code so I will be only adding what I can. :(

# Embedding PDf Using HTMl
This is a simple example of embedding PDFs on HTML pages such that the PDF can be read from the page itself while not having to quarantine the PDF from the page or forcing a download option.

This is especially helpful in cases where the framework themselves can not render the PDF on the webpage, like the case in Django. This is the primary reason behind the upload of this example.

Embedding can be done with local, static files as well as over the cloud or URL-based formats. Both of which have been demonstrated in the example.
